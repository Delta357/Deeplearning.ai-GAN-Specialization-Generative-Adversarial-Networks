#DeepLearning.ai GAN Specialization Courses Notes
This repository contains my personal notes on [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) GAN specialization courses notes.
DeepLearning.ai contains two courses which can be taken on Coursera. The two courses are:
1. ![Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Specialization/tree/master/1%20-%20Build%20Basic%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks)
2. Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks

* upcoming course launches will be announced
### The Specialization course will be launched by 30 September
